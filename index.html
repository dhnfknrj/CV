        <td><h1>Dhanraj Singh Puri</h1>
        <p><em>Masters student and <strong> <a href="https://ussu.co.uk/community/raising-and-giving/">RAG chair 23/24</a></strong> at the University of Surrey</em></p>
        <p>Dhanraj Singh Puri was born on May 19 in the year 2000. Throughout his schooling years of childhood and adolescence, he switched between 11 schooling institutions, ambiguously attaining amphibious amounts of both sociological and educational exposure from each. The relatively high levels of quantitative socio-environmental altercations he experienced as a result allowed him to attain the much desirable personality trait of socio-psychological adaptability. He earned his Black Belt in Shotokan Karate at the age of 13 after over 6 years of investing unarguably overwhelming degrees of hard work in terms of consistency, commitment, and psychophysiological endurance. He participated in a multitude of plantation drives as a companion of his mother, who has a motto of successfully and sustainably planting 10 million trees. He was instrumental in proposing two critical ideas for plantation procedures and initiatives, such as the usage of seed bombs and the implementation of green Ganesha. A seed bomb is a theoretical approach that involves throwing a mud seed bomb that is spherical on barren land, which subsequently blooms and grows into a tree. Green Ganesha is another approach where mud is utilized for the structural and monumental creation of lord Ganesha. This is conducted as an intervention when people carry out their holy practices, (more profoundly known as Visarjan in the Hindu culture which involves letting the holy structure go in the water) to let the seeds within the structure bloom and become river planters and if you do Visarjan at home by just pouring water on the structure it will dissolve to oblivion and seeds will be mixed with soil that we provide in the planter where the Ganesha is placed. In addition, even on occasions when Visarjan is not practiced, the proposed approach will irrespectively trigger the blooming of a certain number of smaller plants.</p>

        <p>He completed his final years of schooling at GD Goenka World School from Gurgaon, India, which was shortly followed by his decision to major in International Business with a minor in Computer Science from Vancouver, Canada. Currently, he is nearing the conclusion of his Bachelor of Commerce from Indira Gandhi National Open University. Following his high school education, he got certifications from Harvard for entrepreneurship in emerging economies and from IIM Banglore for the essentials of marketing.</p>

        <p>Dhanraj came forward to proactively assist with mitigation efforts during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic by creating several WhatsApp groups and a website to deliver critical resources that immeasurably assisted countless struggling families in need. The overall mission was to reach every corner of his home country of India and address all resource depravities by increasing availability through the establishment of definitive supply lines.</p>

        <p>Some of the most notable examples of the involved efforts include the steady provision of oxygen cylinders and the overwhelmingly rare life-saving pharmaceutical compounds to those in desperate need. In addition, the website of his organization was tirelessly contributive towards promoting these endeavors so the struggling communities are acquainted with the knowledge of critical resources being available and undergoing efficient allocation and communal distribution. These efforts, in turn, led to his receival of the Covid Warriors Award by the governor of Maharashtra, Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari.</p>

        <p>Dhanraj possesses extensive experience with international travel solely to understand the degrees of cultural and integral dynamism that exists across varying geographical locations. Preceding, he visited Dubai, Singapore, and Malaysia, and made two subsequent trips to the United States for this particular purpose. In addition, he also made active movements in the corporate sector by being involved with two distinct business organizations in total.</p>

        <p>Firstly, he was the founder of D-Ethos, an Ayurvedic corporation that specializes in the production and distribution of organic medicinal supplements. Most formidably, the company's mission statement is the unparalleled promotion of leading a healthy lifestyle through organic practices while retaining the original philosophical and structural framework that surrounds the abundantly practiced concept of Ayurveda. Secondly, his other business venture involved the sale of print-on-demand t-shirts, which were primarily produced and distributed in The United States.</p>

        <p>Although an amphibious rate of personal and professional success was achieved in both of his corporate endeavors and he was able to attain a certain degree of experience in operating across a variety of markets, it was not enough to satisfy the broader ambitions that envelope his vision and approach towards achieving un-deflectable growth. This includes the establishment of a globalized for-profit business organization that vitalizes the fundamental needs of the Indian subcontinent first before those of international markets.</p>

        <p>Dhanraj has it in his firm belief that the acquisition of easily applicable solutions that are also consecutively both sustainable and efficient is unarguably one of the most effective approaches in amending the complete deprivation of socio-cultural norms our country has been facing. His passion for social work that seeks to support the nourishment of human society on a macroscopic level sets him apart as an individual with considerably notable qualities in terms of contributing toward a more reputable tomorrow, which is what he aims to achieve through his efforts. </p></td>
